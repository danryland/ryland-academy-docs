title: Prime factors

**Prime numbers** are unique because they can only be divided by 1 and themselves, leaving no leftovers or remainders.

**Prime factors** are special prime numbers that, when multiplied together, create a larger number, known as a **composite number**.

**Prime factorisation** is the process of breaking a number down into its prime numbers, which are like the fundamental building blocks that, when multiplied, reconstruct the original number.

### Highest common factor

The **highest common factor (HCF)** the biggest number that can evenly divide both of your numbers.

### Lowest common multiple

The **lowest/least common multiple (LCM)** is the smallest number that both of your numbers can fit into evenly.
